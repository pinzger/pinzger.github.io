  description: "This paper presents a retrospective on our research on ChangeDistiller that pioneered the use of abstract syntax trees and associated tree edits for change analysis. We were among the first to introduce a tree-differencing algorithm for source code, enabling a fine-grained examination of modifications. ChangeDistiller has since been widely adopted by researchers in the field of mining software repositories. We reflect on the evolution of our technique, its influence on subsequent research, and its role in the advancement of change analysis methodologies. In addition, we explore how contemporary techniques and tools can draw on our foundational work to enhance their effectiveness."

  year: 2024
  description: "This paper reports on the findings of 17 semi-structured interviews with developers, architects, and managers in 11 companies to identify microservice API evolution strategies and challenges in practice. In total, we identified six strategies and six challenges for REpresentational State Transfer (REST) and event-driven communication via message brokers. The strategies mainly focus on API backward compatibility, versioning, and close collaboration between teams. The challenges include change impact analysis efforts, ineffective communication of changes, and consumer reliance on outdated versions, leading to API design degradation. We defined two important problems in microservice API evolution resulting from the challenges and their coping strategies: tight organizational coupling and consumer lock-in. To mitigate these two problems, we propose automating the change impact analysis and investigating effective communication of changes as open research directions."

  description: "In this paper, we present PASDA, a partition-based semantic differencing approach with best effort classification of undecided cases. It uses symbolic execution (Symbolic PathFinder) to check the equivalence of all paths found in two versions of a Java program to be either equivalent or non-equivalent, as well as a best effort classification for undecided cases. These are cases, for which the solver (Z3) used by PASDA cannot find a solution or PASDA times out. A comparison with three state-of-the-art approaches showed that PASDA outperforms them in terms of accuracy by 3%-7% on program-level. Moreover, PASDA provides partition-level results also for undecided cases and we briefly discuss the value of this information in three potential uses cases."

  description: "In this paper, we propose DValidator, an approach that considers dependencies on project level and method call level for validating dependencies in build configurations. First, DValidator encodes a project’s dependency graph as specified in a build configuration and its call graph into a representation using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Then it uses Clingo as a solver to detect problems with the dependencies in that build configuration. In a preliminary evaluation with four open source Maven projects we show that our approach can detect selected dependency smells in less than eight seconds. Next steps concern the investigation of our approach for automatically improving dependency configurations, such as automatically repairing dependency smells and conflicts. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board."

We then present two studies using the build changes extracted from 144 open source Java projects to study the frequency and time of build changes. The results show that the top-10 most frequent change types account for 51% of the build changes. Among them, changes to version numbers and changes to dependencies of the projects occur most frequently. We also observe frequently co-occurring changes, such as changes to the source code management definitions, and corresponding changes to the dependency management system and the dependency declaration. Furthermore, our results show that build changes frequently occur around release days. In particular, critical changes, such as updates to plu- gin configuration parts and dependency insertions, are performed before a release day."

  description: "We propose a new strategy to automatically repair programs that suffer from timestamp overflows that are manifested in comparison expressions. It unifies the benefits of static analysis and automatic program repair avoiding dependency on testing to identify and correct defected code. Our approach performs an abstract analysis over the time domain of a program using a Time Type System to identify the problematic comparison expressions. The repairing strategy rewrites the timestamp comparisons exploiting the binary representation of machine numbers to correct the code. We have validated the applicability of our approach with 20 open source Java projects. The results show that it is able to correctly repair all 246 identified errors. To further validate the reliability of our approach, we have proved the soundness of both, type system and repairing strategy. Furthermore, several patches for three open source projects have been acknowledged and accepted by their developers"

  description: "On question and answer sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), developers use tags to label the content of a post and to support developers in question searching and browsing. However, these tags mainly refer to technological aspects instead of the purpose of the question. Tagging questions with their purpose can add a new dimension to the identification of discussed topics in posts on SO. In this paper, we aim at automating the classification of SO question posts into seven question categories. As a first step, we harmonized existing taxonomies of question categories and then, we manually classified 1,000 SO questions according to our new taxonomy. We then use this data set to automate the classification of posts using two approaches. The results show that using the regular expression approach, we can classify posts into the correct question category with an average precision and recall of 0.90, and an MCC of 0.68."

This is achieved by improving the quality of the generated move and update actions, which are the main source of inaccurate actions generated by previous approaches. To evaluate IJM, we conducted a study with 11 external experts and manually analyzed the accuracy of 2400 randomly selected edit actions. Comparing IJM to GumTree and MTDIFF, the results show that IJM provides better accuracy for move and update actions and is more beneficial to understanding the changes."

With the formal time semantics, our approach determines which integer variables handle time and which statements use or alter their values. Based on this information, it translates these statements into an SMT model that is passed to an SMT solver. The solver formally verifies the correctness of the model and reports the violations of time properties in that program. For the evaluation, we have implemented our approach in a prototype tool and applied it to the source code of 20 Java open source projects. The results show that our approach is scalable and it is capable of detecting time errors precisely enough allowing its usability in real-world applications."

We evaluated the three strategies on 84 additional broken builds from the 23 studied projects. The evaluation shows that BUILDMEDIC can automatically repair 45 of these broken builds (54%). Furthermore, in 36% of the successfully repaired build breakages, BUILDMEDIC outputs at least one repair candidate that is considered a correct repair. Moreover, 76% of them could be repaired with only a single dependency correction."
