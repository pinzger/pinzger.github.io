# Software Engineering Research Group

Our mission is to research and teach theories, methods, processes, and techniques for **building and evolving large, complex, and long-living software systems**. We aim at adding the **engineering** to the profession of software developers, making their live more productive and cheerful, and resulting in software systems of high quality. SERG is led by Martin Pinzger and part of the [Department of Informatics Systems](https://www.aau.at/en/isys/), [Faculty of Technical Sciences](http://www.aau.at/tewi/), at the [Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt](http://www.aau.at/).

### Studying Computer Science at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt

Our university offers an attractive and international program for doing a Bachelor, Master, and/or a Doctorate in Computer Science. As one of our Master students stated: "Studying computer science at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt offers a challenging road that is rewarded with great job opportunities." For more information see the study guides on the Bachelor, Master and Doctorate programs.

**We** are looking for students with strong technical or research skills for doing a Master's Thesis or a Softwarepraktika with us. We have a number of open thesis projects also in collaboration with industry. Find out more info on our open thesis projects on this web-site. Regarding Softwarepraktika check out this web-site.

### Collaborating with SERG
In addition to basic research, we have a big interest in performing applied research whose results are transferred to industry, governmental institutions, and open source communities. The collaborations of SERG with X-Automata, Philips Healthcare, KPMG, Robeco, and the Software Improvement Group (SIG) are good examples of such a knowledge transfer. If you are interested in a collaboration with SERG, e.g., in form of a partner in a research project, sponsor of our research, or in some other form, please contact us.

We are grateful for funding from the [Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt](http://www.aau.at/), [FWF](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/), and [FFG](https://www.ffg.at/en).
