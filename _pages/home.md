I am a Full Professor of Software Engineering at the [Universität Klagenfurt](http://www.aau.at/), Austria. I am leading the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://www.aau.at/en/isys/serg) and I am currently also serving as the head of the [Department of Informatics Systems](https://www.aau.at/en/isys/). I received a MSc (Dipl. Ing.) in 2001 and PhD (Dr. techn.) in 2005 in informatics from the Vienna University of Technology, both with distinction. I was a Postdoc at the University of Zurich and an Assistant Professor at the Delft University of Technology from which I received tenure in 2012. In 2012, I won a prestigious [NWO Vidi grant](http://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2012/NWO+awards+Vidi+grants+to+94+top+researchers.html) for my research proposal on recording and analysis of fine-grained code changes. In 2013, I received an [ICSE 2013 ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper award](http://2013.icse-conferences.org/content/icse2013-awards.html) for our work on data clone detection in spreadsheets and the [ICSM 2013 most influential paper award](http://icsm2013.tue.nl/AwardWinners/index.html) for our work on the release history database. In 2014, I received the [ICSME 2014 best paper award](http://www.icsme.org/2014) for our work on a genetic algorithm to refactor fat Java interfaces. I am a member of ACM and a senior member of IEEE.

My research interests are in:

* software evolution
* mining software repositories
* program analysis
* software visualization
* automating software engineering tasks

I am always on the lookout for PhD and Master Students with strong technical and research skills for doing a PhD or Master's Thesis with me. See [wanted](wanted) for more information or drop me an email.
