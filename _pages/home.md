I am a full professor and chair of software engineering at the [Universität Klagenfurt](http://www.aau.at/), Austria. There I am leading the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://www.aau.at/en/isys/serg) and I am currently also serving as the head of the [Department of Informatics Systems](https://www.aau.at/en/isys/). I received a MSc (Dipl. Ing.) in 2001 and PhD (Dr. techn.) in 2005 in informatics from the Vienna University of Technology, both with distinction. I was a Postdoc at the University of Zurich and an Assistant Professor at the Delft University of Technology from which I received tenure in 2012. In 2012, I won a prestigious [NWO Vidi grant](http://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2012/NWO+awards+Vidi+grants+to+94+top+researchers.html) for my research proposal on recording and analysis of fine-grained code changes. In 2013, I received an [ICSE 2013 ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper award](http://2013.icse-conferences.org/content/icse2013-awards.html) for our work on data clone detection in spreadsheets and the [ICSM 2013 most influential paper award](http://icsm2013.tue.nl/AwardWinners/index.html) for our work on the release history database. In 2014, I received the [ICSME 2014 best paper award](http://www.icsme.org/2014) for our work on a genetic algorithm to refactor fat Java interfaces. I am a member of ACM and a senior member of IEEE.

My research interests are in:

* software evolution
* mining software repositories
* program analysis
* software visualization
* automating software engineering tasks

I am always on the lookout for PhD and Master Students with strong technical and research skills for doing a PhD or Master's Thesis with me. See [wanted](wanted) for more information or drop me an email.

#### We are hiring! 
I am looking for a PhD student to work on analyzing and preventing vulnerabilities in robotic systems (DevSafe) in the [SEEROSE](https://www.aau.at/forschung/forschungsprofil/karl-popper-kolleg/seerose/) project. For more information see the [DevSafe job announcement](https://jobs.aau.at/en/job/pre-doc-scientist-f-m-d-software-engineering/). The deadline for submitting your application is **September 30th, 2020**.

#### ERRoSS
I am co-organizing the [1st International Workshop on Engineering Resilient Robot Software Systems](https://www.erross.org/) (ERRoSS) co-located with [IRC 2020](http://irc.asia.edu.tw/2020). We welcome submissions of research, work-in-progress, lessons learned, and vision papers. Note, due to the Coronavirus, IRC 2020 and ERRoSS 2020 have been moved to **November 9-11th, 2020**. They will go fully virtual.
