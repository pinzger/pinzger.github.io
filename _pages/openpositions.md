**Limited to:** 4 years<br/>
**Starting date:** as soon as possible<br/>
**Application deadline:** applications will be considered **until** the position  is filled<br/>

The successful candidate will contribute to the research project SemImpact: Change Impact Analysis for Microservice-based Systems. The goal of the SemImpact project is to explore novel methods and techniques that enable software developers and system integrators to accurately determine and understand the semantic impact of code and API changes in microservice-based systems, and to use this information to improve the cost-effectiveness of change impact understanding tasks and regression testing. The project is funded by the Austrian FWF and will be performed by the Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the University of Klagenfurt. 

### Tasks comprise
* Investigation of methods and techniques for determining, understanding, and testing the semantic impact of code and API changes in microservice-based systems
* Implementation of research prototypes to demonstrate the methods and techniques 
* Evaluation of the methods and techniques using formal and empirical research methods
* Writing scientific publications and presenting them in renowned journals and at international conferences
* Participation in teaching software engineering courses (optionally)

The successful candidate is expected to pursue a PhD within the doctoral programme [Informatics](https://www.aau.at/en/doctoral-programme/prospective-doctoral-students/thematic-doctoral-programmes/informatics/) at the University of Klagenfurt.

### Requirements for candidates are
* Master’s degree in computer science or informatics
* Profound knowledge in one or more of the following areas
   * Microservices
   * Program analysis
   * Abstract interpretation
   * Symbolic execution
   * Software testing
* Very good programming skills in at least one popular programming language 
* Fluency in English 

### Desired are
* Experiences with formal methods
* Experiences with performing empirical studies
* Good communicator, strong social skills, and team player
* Independent working style

### Applications must include
* A detailed resume (with publications, if you have any)
* A motivational letter specifically referring to the open position (maximum 3 pages)
* Copies of marks and degrees/certificates
* A list of 3 references that we can contact
* Your MSc thesis in English (or alternative if your MSc thesis is not in English, a 5-page summary of your MSc thesis in English).

Please submit your application as PDF files *as early as possible* via email to [Kerstin Smounig](mailto:kerstin.smounig@aau.at). Please mention **SemImpact** in the email subject. Note, applications will be considered until the position is filled.
