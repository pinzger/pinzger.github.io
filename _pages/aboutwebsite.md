# Mission
The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) investigates and teaches theories, methods, processes, and techniques for building and evolving large, complex, and long-living software systems. We aim at adding the engineering to the profession of software developers, making their live more productive and more cheerful, and resulting in software systems of high quality.

# Theme
Core topics of our research and teaching comprise:

* software evolution
* mining software repositories
* software analytics
* software maintenance and re-engineering
* formal methods in software engineering
* software specification and verification
* program analysis
* empirical software engineering
* end-user programming


We investigate the application of these technologies to the development of large and distributed software systems, keeping in mind that:

* software engineering is more than programming a first release of a system
* software engineering emphasizes fundamental principles and techniques
* software engineering follows engineering principles and processes
* software engineering is a team sport

The IEEE Std 610.12-1990's Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (ANSI) defines software engineering as _the application of a systematic, dicsiplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software_.
