# Courses 

I enjoy teaching several courses in the [Bachelor](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/bachelor-applied-informatics/) and [Master](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/master-applied-informatics/) of Applied Informatics at the Universit√§t Klagenfurt. A [full list of my courses](https://campus.aau.at/studien/lvliste.jsp?atoken=1771224091) is available from our campus system.

## Softwarepraktika and Student Projects
Practical courses and projects give bachelor and master students the opportunity to participate in (large) industrial software projects or to get in touch with the scientific research performed in our research group. For performing a practical course or project at a company, students are encouraged to get in touch with the company and propose a project. For performing a practical course or project with our research group, please drop me an email.

### Assignments in Industry
We collaborate with a number of companies in Carinthia, such as [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/cms/austria/en/), [Mazda IT](http://www.mazda.at/), and many others. They offer assignments for Softwarepraktika and Student Projects. Please contact the company for open assignments or drop me an email. <strong>But</strong> note, we can and can not supervise projects requiring us to sign an NDA from the company, potentially limiting our freedom in research.

### Assignments at SERG
These assignments are performed in our research group. They offer students an excellent opportunity to get in touch with an internationally renowned research group in the area of software engineering. We offer a professional environment and, for some assignments, also a financial compensation for excellent work. 

Various assignments in the areas of change and change impact analysis, program analysis, software visualization, and automating software engineering tasks are available. **Note**, for all our assignments, candidates need to a have a very strong background in programming.

Interested? Please drop me an email to discuss the assignments in more detail.
