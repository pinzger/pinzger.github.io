# Courses 

I enjoy teaching several courses in the [Bachelor](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/bachelor-applied-informatics/) and [Master](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/master-applied-informatics/) of Applied Informatics at the Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt. A [full list of my courses](https://campus.aau.at/studien/lvliste.jsp?atoken=1771224091) is available from our campus system.

I am also responsible for designing the [Bachelor](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/bachelor-applied-informatics/) and [Master](https://www.aau.at/en/studien/master-applied-informatics/) curricula in Applied Informatics.


## Softwarepraktika, Research- and Praxissemesters
Practical courses give master students the opportunity to participate in (large) industrial software projects or to get in contact with the scientific research performed in our research group. For performing a practical course at a company, students are encouraged to get in contact with the company and propose a project. For performing a practical course within our research group, please drop me an email.

### Assignments in Industry (Softwarepraktika, Praxissemesters)
We collaborate with a number of companies in Carinthia, such as [Mazda IT](http://www.mazda.at/), [Peaksolutions](http://www.peaksolution.com/), [Skidata](https://www.skidata.com/), [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/cms/austria/en/), and many others. They offer assignments for Softwarepraktika and Praxissemesters. Please contact the company for open assignments or drop me an email.

### Assignments at SERG (Forschungssemester)
These assignments are performed within our research group. They offer students an excellent opportunity to get in touch with an internationally renowned research group in the area of software engineering. Se offer a professional environment and, for some assignments, also a financial compensation for excellent work. Currently, the following assignments are available.

#### Reengineering and Improving DA4Java
The main goal of this assignment is to reengineer our existing source code visualization tool DA4Java to use a new, open source graphic library. DA4Java is an Eclipse plug-in implemented in Java that uses Hibernate to access the database and a commercial graph library to visualize the graphs. For the new version of DA4Java, we plan to use an open source graph library, e.g., JGraph. As another option, we are also open for a complete re-implementation of the tool using new technologies for storing and visualizing graphs, such as [neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) and/or [d3js](http://d3js.org/). Furthermore, we are also open for new features and improvements of DA4Java.

**Requirements**: Candidates need to a have strong background in Java programming and should be knowledgeable in implementing Eclipse plug-ins.
