# Wanted - PhD and Master Students

I am always on the lookout for PhD and Master Students with strong technical and research skills for doing a PhD or Master's Thesis with me. The topics of a thesis project with me are in the area of:

* software evolution
* mining software repositories
* program analysis
* software visualization
* automating software engineering tasks

A thesis project with me offers you the opportunity:

* to dig deep into a recent research topic in the area of software engineering 
* to learn and play with bleeding edge technologies
* to work in a well connected and known international research team

Below is a list of Thesis projets that are currently available. Of course, you are welcome to propose your own topic. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me.

### Automating Software Engineering Tasks
Software developers are typically burdened with (too) many tasks that involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, refactoring, testing, documenting, etc.. Recent research has indicated some potential to automate parts of some of these tasks to "some" extent. The goal of these thesis projects is to find out to which extent it is possible to automate these tasks. Thesis projects comprise the investigation of mining and deep/machine learning techniques as well as the implementation of prototype tools (that can be integrated into modern software development environments) to automate these tasks.

### Software Evolution Analysis
Software repositories, such as versioning systems, bug repositories, and mailing lists, keep track of issues and changes in a software project. Access to these repositories are provided by online collaboration platforms, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [Google Code](http://code.google.com/). They store a wealth of information from which we can learn a number of general and project specific best practices to better develop and maintain software. Thesis projects comprise the investigation and adaptation of different data mining and machine learning techniques to identify best and bad practices and the investigation of useful means to provide them to software developers in form of advisory/recommender techniques.

### Software Visualization
Program understanding still accounts for more than 50% of software developing costs. Software visualization techniques are a means to lower that by relying on the visual capabilities of humans. In our previous research, we have developed several visualization tools, such as DA4Java to browse, and navigate object-oriented source code, and SNAnalyzer to browse the contributions of developers to a software project. Thesis projects comprise various extensions of our visualization techniques, development of new visualization techniques, as well as, the inclusion of new data sources that can be leveraged to improve the comprehension of programs, their changes, collaborations, and the localization of failures in programs.

### Spreadsheet Analysis
Spreadsheets are used extensively in business for all sorts of tasks and purposes and often for business-critical applications. They are end-user programs that underly similar rules as traditional software systems. While the quality of software is checked more rigorously this is not true for spreadsheets, especially with respect to maintainability. Thesis projects comprise the investigation of metrics to measure the complexity of spreadsheets and their risk of failure, as well as visualization techniques to allow spreadsheet users to better understand complex spreadsheets.
